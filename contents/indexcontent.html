                <p>
                Elemento Modular Cloud solutions are made of simple functional modules called Elements.
                Multiple connected Elements collectively provide advanced functionalities.
                Elements installation is as easy as plugging in power and network connectivity.

                An existing deployment can either be easily expanded, or scaled to zero, without reconfiguration.
                The Elements are equipped with routines to clone already deployed Elements, to ease ingestion of new hardware.
