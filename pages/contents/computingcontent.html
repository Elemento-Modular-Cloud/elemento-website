        <emphasis>Attention to details: a concrete standard</emphasis>

        Computing Elements are built around the best-in-class hardware components.
        Each Computing Element implements the state of the art technologies in our standard format.
        
        Thanks to our own architecture, based on industry standards, Computing Elements provide merely computing power.
        
        The infrastructural segmentation reduces the overall management effort and improves bare metal reachability in case of failures.
        
        At Elemento we believe the best way to prevent failures is attention to details.
        
        That's why we do deeply test every component installed in our products, both at the planning as well as during and after the building phase.

        Technology progress is never ending, breaking most scaling thumbs rules.
        
        At Elemento we focus on connecting the most advanced hardware with plenty of tests and choosing wisely.
        
        Our Elements are made of the best components packed in a standard format.
        
        This feature ensures unrivalled compatibility, expandabilty and scaling even in small deployments.

        <emphasis>Two is better than one. What about many?</emphasis>
        
        Costly accelerators are a big investment and faults are time and money expensive.

        For this reason, the most advanced Compute Elements are provided with a redundance hardware layer between accelerators and hosts.
        In case of failures the critical device is disconnected and it's hot spare takes it's place, limiting as much as possible downtimes.

        Thanks to the modular design, every Elemento focuses on maximizing one of the characteristics of the underlying hardware.
        
        Maximum frequency and low core count for high frequency trading.
        
        Maximum performance for power consumption unit for the most efficient computing toolbox.
        
        Huge memory capacity for the most demanding memory-bound tasks.
